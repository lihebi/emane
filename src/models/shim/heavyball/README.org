#+TITLE: Heavy ball implementation as Shim layer

* Introduction

This implements the heavy-ball scheduler layer as a Shim layer. It
includes three major parts:

- It should register and process the pathloss event, and record as
  channel state.

- It should implements the TDMA scheduler logic, i.e. maintaining
  queues of messages and deciding which is processed next. The
  heavy-ball schedule algorithm comes into play for this decision.

- It should be able to communicate current queue length and channel
  state to the outside traffic generator for congestion control. This
  traffic generator currently means the dynamic mgen implemented in
  the [[https://github.com/lihebi/heavy-ball][heavy-ball
  front-end]]. The current strategy is using a system socket, which
  should be fine.
